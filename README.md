After that, the user can log in to the app. The app features a dashboard that displays each task, allowing you to view, edit, or delete them. You can filter tasks by due date and also sort them by creation date or due date. Additionally, you can delete all tasks that are due with a single button. The app also includes a profile page where you can update your password, profile image, and change the cover photo for all users.
